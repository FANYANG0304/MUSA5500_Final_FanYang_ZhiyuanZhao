We also acknowledge the limitations of this study and suggest directions for future research.\n\n## Summary of Key Findings\n\n### Model Performance\n\nOur PU Learning approach achieved strong predictive performance:\n\n![ROC Curves showing model performance](../images/roc_curve.png){width=70%}\n\n| Metric | Logistic Regression | Random Forest |\n|--------|-------------------|---------------|\n| AUC-ROC | 0.968 ± 0.013 | 0.939 ± 0.045 |\n| Training samples | 28 positive + ~9,000 negative |\n| Features | 13 (6 visual + 7 socioeconomic) |\n\nThe high AUC indicates that happiness points are systematically different from random street locations in measurable ways.\n\n### Feature Impact Visualization\n\nThe lollipop chart below visualizes the direction and magnitude of each feature's effect on happiness:\n\n![Feature Effects on Happiness (Lollipop Chart)](../images/lollipop_chart.png){width=90%}\n\nKey observations from the visualization:\n\n- **Building Ratio** has the strongest positive effect (+1.00), indicating happiness points cluster in denser urban areas\n- **Owner Occupied Rate** has the strongest negative effect (-2.10), our most surprising finding\n- **College Educated** and **Sky Ratio** are strong positive predictors\n- **Poverty Rate** and **Road Ratio** are strong negative predictors\n\n### Rose Chart: Feature Importance by Direction\n\n![Feature Importance Rose Chart](../images/rose_chart.png){width=80%}\n\nThe rose chart provides an alternative view, showing positive effects (blue) radiating outward and negative effects (red) in the opposite direction. This visualization makes it easy to see that socioeconomic factors (owner-occupancy, poverty, education) have larger magnitudes than most visual features.\n\n### Feature Impact Summary\n\nBased on logistic regression coefficients (standardized):\n\n**Positive factors** (higher values → more happiness):\n\n| Rank | Feature | Coefficient | Interpretation |\n|------|---------|------------|----------------|\n| 1 | building_ratio | +1.00 | Dense urban areas with amenities |\n| 2 | pct_college | +0.70 | Educated neighborhoods |\n| 3 | sky_ratio | +0.58 | Open views, psychological comfort |\n| 4 | median_income | +0.18 | Better-maintained environments |\n| 5 | green_view_index | +0.06 | Modest vegetation benefit |\n\n**Negative factors** (higher values → less happiness):\n\n| Rank | Feature | Coefficient | Interpretation |\n|------|---------|------------|----------------|\n| 1 | pct_owner_occupied | -2.10 | \"Livability paradox\" |\n| 2 | poverty_rate | -1.28 | Environmental degradation |\n| 3 | road_ratio | -1.23 | Car-centric design |\n| 4 | vehicle_ratio | -0.29 | Traffic presence |\n| 5 | person_ratio | -0.24 | Overcrowding |\n\n---\n\n## The Owner-Occupancy Paradox\n\nThe most striking finding is the strong **negative** relationship between homeownership rate and happiness (coefficient = -2.10).\n\n### Conventional Wisdom vs. Our Finding\n\nTraditional urban planning often equates high homeownership with neighborhood quality:\n\n- Homeowners invest in property maintenance\n- Stable populations build community\n- Lower crime rates in owner-occupied areas\n\nYet our model finds the opposite relationship with happiness points.\n\n### Proposed Explanation: \"Livability\" ≠ \"Happiness\"\n\nWe hypothesize that **what makes a neighborhood good for living differs from what makes a place feel happy**.\n\n**High-ownership neighborhoods** (typically suburban-style):\n\n- Quiet, safe, low activity\n- Single-use residential zoning\n- Car-dependent for daily needs\n- Few spontaneous social encounters\n\n**Happiness points** (based on our survey data):\n\n- Mixed-use urban areas\n- Walkable with nearby amenities\n- Active street life\n- Diverse activities and people\n\n### Supporting Evidence\n\nConsider the characteristics of our 28 happiness points:\n\n::: {#05575d65 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Comparing happiness points to city averages\nhappy_stats = df[df['is_happy'] == 1].mean()\ncity_stats = df.mean()\n\ncomparison = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Happiness Points': happy_stats,\n    'City Average': city_stats\n})\n\nprint(comparison[['pct_owner_occupied', 'building_ratio', 'road_ratio']])\n```\n:::\n\n\n| Metric | Happiness Points | City Average |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Owner-occupancy | 34.2% | 52.3% |\n| Building ratio | 21.3% | 18.8% |\n| Road ratio | 19.6% | 22.3% |\n\nHappiness points are located in areas with:\n\n- **18 percentage points lower** owner-occupancy\n- **2.5 percentage points higher** building density\n- **2.7 percentage points lower** road coverage\n\nThis pattern is consistent with walkable, urban neighborhoods rather than suburban residential areas.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Environment Factors\n\n### Sky Visibility\n\nSky ratio emerged as a significant positive predictor (+0.58). This aligns with research on:\n\n- **Psychological openness**: Visible sky reduces feelings of confinement\n- **Natural light**: Better daylight improves mood and well-being\n- **Urban canyon effect**: Tall buildings blocking sky create oppressive environments\n\n### Building Density\n\nContrary to some expectations, **higher building density predicts higher happiness** (+1.00). This suggests that happiness is associated with:\n\n- Access to amenities, services, and activities\n- Social interaction opportunities\n- Urban vitality and \"buzz\"\n\nThe key distinction: building density within limits that still allow sky visibility. The simultaneous positive effects of both building_ratio and sky_ratio suggest happiness is found in **moderately dense** urban environments—not sprawling suburbs or oppressive downtown canyons.\n\n### Road Coverage\n\nRoad ratio is a strong negative predictor (-1.23), supporting the \"livable streets\" movement's argument that car-centric design diminishes quality of life:\n\n- More road = less space for pedestrians, bikes, greenery\n- Road presence indicates traffic noise and pollution exposure\n- Wide roads create barriers to crossing, fragmenting neighborhoods\n\n---\n\n## Socioeconomic Factors\n\n### Education and Income\n\nBoth `pct_college` (+0.70) and `median_income` (+0.18) positively predict happiness. These likely operate through:\n\n- **Neighborhood investment**: Higher-income areas have better maintenance\n- **Amenity quality**: Restaurants, shops, and public spaces may be higher quality\n- **Selection effects**: Survey respondents may gravitate toward areas similar to their own neighborhoods\n\n### Poverty Rate\n\nStrong negative effect (-1.28) reflects the accumulated disadvantages of high-poverty neighborhoods:\n\n- Deferred maintenance and visible decay\n- Higher crime and perceived safety concerns\n- Fewer commercial establishments and services\n\n---\n\n## Spatial Distribution\n\n### Mapping Happiness Scores\n\nAfter applying our model to all ~30,000 sampling points, we can visualize predicted happiness across Philadelphia:\n\n![Predicted Happiness Scores Across Philadelphia](../images/happiness_prediction_map.png){width=100%}\n\nThe choropleth map reveals clear spatial clustering:\n\n- **Highest scores (0.8-1.0, lightest)**: Center City, University City, parts of Fairmount and Northern Liberties\n- **Moderate scores (0.4-0.6)**: Inner-ring neighborhoods with mixed uses\n- **Lowest scores (0.0-0.2, darkest)**: Outer residential neighborhoods, industrial zones, and highway corridors\n\n### Spatial Patterns\n\nThe happiness score map reveals clustering in:\n\n1. **Center City and surrounding neighborhoods**: High density, mixed-use, walkable\n2. **University City**: Campus environments with public spaces\n3. **Some waterfront areas**: Open views, recreational amenities\n4. **Historic districts**: Preserved walkable urban fabric\n\nLow-scoring areas tend to be:\n\n1. **Outer residential neighborhoods**: Car-dependent, single-use zoning\n2. **Industrial zones**: Low amenity, high infrastructure presence\n3. **High-poverty areas in North and West Philadelphia**\n\n---\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Sample Size\n\nWith only 28 positive samples, our findings should be interpreted cautiously:\n\n- Statistical power is limited for detecting small effects\n- Unusual characteristics of individual points may unduly influence results\n- Cross-validation produces small validation sets (~5-6 positives per fold)\n\n### Selection Bias\n\nSurvey respondents were Drexel University students, introducing potential biases:\n\n- Age: Predominantly young adults\n- Geography: Oversampling near campus\n- Lifestyle: Student-relevant locations emphasized\n\n### Temporal Stability\n\nOur analysis uses static data:\n\n- Street view images from a single time point\n- Census data averaged over 5 years\n- No accounting for seasonal, weekly, or daily variations\n\n### Causal Inference\n\nThis is a correlational study. We cannot claim that building density *causes* happiness—the relationship could be:\n\n- **Confounded**: Both caused by a third factor\n- **Reversed**: Happy people might seek out dense areas\n- **Complex**: Interactions and non-linearities we don't model\n\n---\n\n## Implications for Urban Planning\n\nDespite limitations, our findings suggest several urban planning considerations:\n\n### 1. Reconsider Density\n\nThe simultaneous positive effects of building density and sky visibility suggest an optimal density range—enough activity to be vibrant, not so much as to be oppressive. This supports:\n\n- **Mid-rise development** over sprawl or super-tall towers\n- **Setback requirements** to preserve street-level openness\n- **Rooftop gardens and terraces** to add visible greenery at height\n\n### 2. Reduce Car Dominance\n\nThe negative effects of road and vehicle coverage support:\n\n- **Road diets**: Converting vehicle lanes to pedestrian, bike, or green space\n- **Traffic calming**: Speed reduction, pedestrianization of key streets\n- **Parking reform**: Reducing surface parking, encouraging structured/underground\n\n### 3. Address Equity\n\nThe strong negative effect of poverty rate highlights that happiness is not equally distributed. Planning interventions should prioritize:\n\n- **Investing in high-poverty neighborhoods**: Parks, streetscaping, façade improvements\n- **Mixed-income development**: Avoiding concentration of disadvantage\n- **Public space quality**: Ensuring all neighborhoods have pleasant public realm\n\n### 4. Embrace Mixed-Use\n\nThe owner-occupancy paradox suggests purely residential areas, however nice, may not generate happiness. Support for:\n\n- **Mixed-use zoning**: Allow retail, services, and housing together\n- **15-minute neighborhoods**: Daily needs within walking distance\n- **Third places**: Cafes, libraries, community centers that foster social interaction\n\n---\n\n## Future Directions\n\nThis study opens several avenues for future research:\n\n1. **Expand positive samples**: Crowdsourced happiness mapping could provide hundreds or thousands of points\n\n2. **Temporal analysis**: Compare street view images across seasons and years\n\n3. **Multi-city comparison**: Do the same features predict happiness in different urban contexts?\n\n4. **Deep learning features**: Use CNN-extracted features rather than semantic segmentation categories\n\n5. **Qualitative validation**: Interview respondents about why they chose specific locations\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study demonstrates that urban happiness is measurable and predictable from environmental features. Our key findings:\n\n1. **Visual features matter**: Sky visibility and building density positively correlate with happiness; road coverage negatively correlates\n\n2. **The owner-occupancy paradox**: High-homeownership neighborhoods are *less* likely to contain happiness points, suggesting \"livability\" and \"happiness\" are distinct concepts\n\n3. **Socioeconomic context**: Education and income positively predict happiness; poverty strongly negatively predicts\n\n4. **Model performance**: PU Learning achieves AUC = 0.968, indicating systematic differences between happiness points and ordinary locations\n\nThese findings provide quantitative support for urban design principles that prioritize pedestrians, density, and mixed-use development over car-centric suburban patterns.\n\n",

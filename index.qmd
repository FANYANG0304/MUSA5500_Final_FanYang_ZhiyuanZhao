What makes a person truly happy? It might be a shared meal with friends, or simply standing in a place that feels right. This project maps the emotional geography of Philadelphia—combining street-view imagery, semantic segmentation, and machine learning to understand what makes urban environments feel "happy."

<u>"A lot of things need fixing in Philly, but there are a lot of good things here."</u>

## Abstract {#abstract}

::: {.abstract-box}
The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung wrote extensively about the relationship between our inner world and the external environment, suggesting that this connection is vital to psychological health. Across cultures and histories, "happy places" share certain universal features—they are often safe, aesthetically pleasing, socially engaging, and meaningful.

This study explores whether these emotional patterns can be recognized from a city's visual appearance. Using 28 happiness points identified by Drexel University students and approximately 40,000 road sampling points across Philadelphia, we employ a **Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning** approach that treats unlabeled locations as potentially happy rather than definitively unhappy. We extract visual features from Google Street View panoramic imagery using semantic segmentation (SegFormer) and combine them with Census tract-level socioeconomic variables to build predictive models.

The result is an emotional geography of Philadelphia—a map not of buildings or roads, but of feelings.

## Key Findings {#key-findings}

::: {.findings-grid}

::: {.finding-card .positive}
::: {.finding-icon}
✓
:::
::: {.finding-content}
**Positive Predictors**

Building density, sky visibility, and education levels positively predict happiness — suggesting urban vitality matters.
:::
:::

::: {.finding-card .negative}
::: {.finding-icon}
✗
:::
::: {.finding-content}
**Negative Predictors**

Owner-occupancy rate, road coverage, and poverty rate are negative predictors — challenging conventional assumptions.

**Key Insight**

Rental-heavy urban areas may offer more social opportunities and public amenities than owner-occupied suburbs.
